# heurist-o-matic
Randomly displays software testing -based heuristics

The Heurist-o-matic was created to make the wealth of software-testing -centric heuristics out there a bit more accessible.
There are plenty of pages that list the heuristic mnemonics, but I wanted to make something that's a bit more helpful.
Plus I wanted an excuse to use my procedurally-generated horizons background :-)

All rights and kudos to the authors of the original mnemonics.
If I've misattributed or otherwise ruined any mnemonic or heuristic, please let me know.
